Incomplete implementation for handling awesome file format called [recfile](https://www.gnu.org/software/recutils/manual/recutils.html).
Supports parsing databases, sex'es, fields encryption and some basic queries. Also my first time writing parsers in Rust.

Very WIP. My hope is that some day it will become part of bigger GUI program for managing your stuff with plain-text databases. Stale while im trying to figure out if writing complex GUI in Rust today is even possible.

Drop a message to `ouxya at pm dot me` if you want to explore on this topic together.
